# run_green_site

## Description
Started building a website relating to being a greener runner; aiming to get a bunch of resources to help others make greener choices etc etc

### Features
Currently it's pretty dull html with little styling and no interactivity, but aiming to change that.

### Technologies
Mostly HTML and CSS, with a smattering of JS. Also using it as an opportunity to do more with FTP, Git and GitHub, as well as domain management.
