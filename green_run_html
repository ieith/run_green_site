        <h1>Seeking a More Environmental Way to Run</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                As time has gone on, I have found myself increasingly inclined towards minimising my environmental impact. Unfortunately, I am also a runner. This means trainers, tshirts, transportation, technical doodads and all the other bumf and paraphernalia that comes with it. Or does it? Do we need all this stuff? Does being a contemporary runner mean being a consumerist runner? Do I need to buy 3 pairs of polarised lenses and change my shoes every 500 miles or whatever? This website is my attempt to answer that question.
                <br><br>
                <h5>About me</h5> 
                I am middle-aged, overweight, vegetarian, a run leader, a trail leader and a member of <a href="https://thegreenrunners.com">The Green Runners</a>. I run long distances not very fast, usually with a decent amount of elevation. My running is not necessarily "running".
                <h5>About this site</h5> 
                This sites serves a threefold purpose: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, it is to document my exploration in increasing my sustainability as a runner and serving as a resource for those on the same journey (sharing knowledge is a key piece in my personal code);</li> 
                    <li>Secondly, as part of my Green Runner's pledge I vowed to be overt in flying the flag (which I am doing through this site)</li>
                    <li>Finally, it allows me to work on my web development skills in a way that actually means something to me.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
