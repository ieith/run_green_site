        <h2>Jacket Zipper</h2>
            <p>
                You've got a banging waterproof jacket. It keeps you dry in the rain, it breathes well. It's confortable and doesn't rustle like a crisp packet....then the zipper stops zipping...
                <br>

                Is it time for a new jacket? I reckon maybe not.
                <h5>Fixing it</h5> 
                I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dewi_runs">YouTube</a> for this, but it's actually pretty easy. The cost of my repair worked out at around 50p and 15 minutes of my time.
                <h5>Steps</h5> 
                This is basically it: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, remove the top stopper;</li> 
                    <img class="top-stopper" src="C:\Users\Dewi\Pictures\top_stop.jpg" width="200">

                    <li>Secondly, run the old zip off the now unstoppered top;</li>
                    <li>Thirdly, run the new zip onto the unstoppered top;</li>
                    <li>Finally, stick a new top stopper on and away you go.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
